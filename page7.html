                    The grand opening of the VI Festival of National Sports took place at the Kazanat Hippodrome in Astana. Over five days, more than 1,300 people will compete in 11 types of sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opening the event, Speaker of the Mazhilis of Parliament, Chairman of the Amanat Party, Yerlan Koshanov, noted that, with the support of the state, national sports are actively developing in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The popularization of national culture and the development of national sports are always at the heart of the Head of State Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's focus. He spoke about their importance for the proper upbringing of young people at the National Kurultai held in Turkestan. National sports are a living reflection of our history and the uniqueness of the Kazakh people. By promoting them, we preserve our spiritual heritage for future generations," said Koshanov.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Speaker of the Mazhilis highlighted the importance of the President's initiative to hold the V World Nomad Games in Kazakhstan next year. International competitions will bring together athletes from many countries and showcase the great potential of modern Kazakhstan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next five days of the festival, athletes will test their skills in kokpar, asyk atu, toguz kumalak, zhekpe-zhek, zhamby atu, tenge alu, and other national games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant event within the festival will be the national equestrian marathon "Uly Dala Zhorygy," organized by the JORYQ Equestrian Federation for the second consecutive year. Over 14 days, 20 teams of riders from all regions of the country will cover a distance of 1,300 kilometers from the capital to Turkestan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The equestrian marathon was held for the first time last year with the support of the Amanat Party. It was a landmark and large-scale event that will have a lasting impact on the development of national equestrian sports in the country. It united all regions of our country. Participants of the marathon will face a challenging journey along historic steppe routes. In addition to sporting achievements, this lays a solid foundation for the development of ethno-tourism and the promotion of our nation’s cultural heritage," emphasized Yerlan Koshanov.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The festival is organized by the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the Akimat of Astana, the Amanat Party, JSC "Samruk-Kazyna" National Welfare Fund, the Association of National Sports, and the Foundation for the Support of Tourism and Sports.
