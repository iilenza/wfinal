                <h1>Kazakhstan Named the Most Innovative Company</h1>

                    On September 19, the annual Kazakhstan Growth Forum took place, where the "X20: Most Innovative Companies in Kazakhstan" study was presented. Experts evaluated financial indicators, the number of specialized professionals, customer experience, and product innovation. Topping the ranking was Beeline Kazakhstan — a digital operator with the widest LTE coverage, chosen as a communications provider by 11 million Kazakhstani citizens. What led Beeline to become a leader in innovation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, over 9 million Beeline clients use services within Beeline's digital ecosystem: watching movies, playing games, listening to music, making payments, taking loans, and storing data in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In 2018, we decided that we didn’t want to be just a channel through which internet content reached the customer. We set a new goal — to be close to the user and enhance their life through advanced digital solutions. This was the beginning of our transformation into a digital operator," says Yevgeny Nastradin, CEO of Beeline Kazakhstan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New technologies are present in every product. For example, biometrics simplify authorization and reduce service time in offices — no need to fill out paper forms; data is pulled up automatically. The "My Beeline" app analyzes user interests and personalizes the main page: relevant offers move to the top. You won’t find two identical pages in "My Beeline."
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than 60 internal and external digital products are connected in one large ecosystem, and a team of 750 specialists supports and enhances its work. In 2023, development reached a new level with the creation of the subsidiary QazCode. Now experts create solutions not only for Beeline but also for other companies in Kazakhstan and even abroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It’s difficult to be an innovative digital company without an in-house development team. Vendor solutions aren’t adapted to local specifics and often require substantial refinement. We can create products more flexibly, quickly, and effectively. For instance, our biometric-based solution ranks 60th out of 500 in the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) international ranking," notes Alexey Sharavar, CEO of QazCode.
