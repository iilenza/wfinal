                <p>
                    The Abai region hosted the medical campaign "Days of the Presidential Medical Center." Over three days, doctors from the hospital and National Hospital conducted 279 consultations and masterclasses, along with 17 surgeries, 13 of which were unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Abai region became the 13th region to host this campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of the event, a memorandum of cooperation was signed between the Akimat of the Abai region and the Presidential Medical Center. The document was signed by the Head of the PMC, Alexey Tsoy, and the region's head, Nurlan Urankhaev.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The head of the region emphasized that the signed memorandum will significantly positively impact the development of the region's healthcare sector in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "To improve the quality of medical care for the region’s population, we prioritize enhancing specialist qualifications, acquiring advanced experience, and technologies. In this regard, it is very important to work with the country's leading clinics, particularly the Presidential Medical Center."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This memorandum opens up opportunities for joint development in medical technologies. Our cooperation will be aimed at sharing experience and supporting the professional growth of doctors. I am confident that this strategic partnership will significantly improve the quality of medical services and contribute to the introduction of modern healthcare technologies," noted the head of the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In turn, the head of the PMC, Alexey Tsoy, emphasized that the signed memorandum should open a new chapter in the development of effective dialogue and strengthening partnerships, as well as expanding scientific and practical ties for the benefit of citizens' health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In each region, we perform up to 30 surgeries during a single visit. Further, we have roadmaps in place for the remaining regions. We systematically train specialists not only in the healthcare system but also in preschool education, sanitary-epidemiological control, and creating a favorable environment in organizations. It’s a comprehensive effort, and we see that at the regional level, in the regions where we have already been, local doctors are already applying these previously unused technologies in practice. There is a positive effect, and feedback from the population indicates that, thanks to improved qualifications, it is no longer necessary to leave the region to receive high-tech medical assistance on site. Therefore, we hope that in Semey, where there are highly qualified personnel and a medical university with strong traditions, this program will work most effectively, and doctors are ready to implement these methods," said Alexey Tsoy in his speech.
